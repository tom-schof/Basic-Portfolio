            <p> Hi, my name is Tom. I grew up in Lexington, VA and currently live in Fairfax, VA with my girlfriend, Liz. I went
                to college at UVA and graduated in May 2015 with a degree in civil engineering. I worked for two years as a civil
                engineer before deciding to change careers and pursue software engineering. I enrolled at George Mason University
                in the Applied Computer Science program and completed one semester before deciding that the pace was too slow
                and looked for alternatives. I found the George Washington University Coding Bootcamp and signed up as soon as
                possible. I am excited to learn cutting edge, job ready skills and be back in the work force so quickly.</p>
            <p> Outside of coding, my two main hobbies are playing guitar and lifting weights. My mother owns a music store and
                my whole family plays music. I play mostly electric guitar and try to play as much as I can. I am also a National
                Academy of Sports Medicine Certified Personal Trainer and can squat 500+ lbs, deadlift 600+ lbs conventional, and
                bench press 300 lbs. </p>
